		<h1>Welcome to Best Project 2015</h1>
		<p>Enter the name you will use:</p>
		<input id="name" type="text">
		<input id="submit" type="submit">
		<p id="instructions">
			Instructions:<br>
			1. Enter a name and hit submit.<br>
			2. Join a room with other players or create a room and wait for the match to begin!<br>
			3. In game, you are set as either a killer, a cop, or an innocent.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. As a killer, your objective is to kill all the innocent players without them determining who you are.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. As a cop, your objective is to determine through investigation and cooperation who the killer is and arrest him.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. As an innocent, your objective is to communicate with the other still-living innocent players and the cop (whose identity is unknown) to arrest all the killers. You may vote to kill one player every turn.<br>
			4. You can move 3000 meters each turn. Movement is based on the streets you walk to get to places. Cops can also choose to arrest a target player.<br>
			5. Hit end turn. This will refresh your movement and change the time from day to night or vice versa. (At night, your visibility is greatly reduced).<br>
			6. The game ends when either all killers are arrested or dead or all innocents and all cops are dead.<br>
