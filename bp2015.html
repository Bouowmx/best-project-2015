      <p id="instructions">Instructions: <br>
	1. Enter a username and hit submit.
	2. Join a room with other players or create a room and wait for the match to begin! <br>
	3. In game, you are set as either a killer, a cop, or an innocent. <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. As a killer, your objective is to kill all the innocent players without them determining who you are. <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. As a cop, your objective is to determine through investigation and cooperation who the killer is and arrest him. <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. As an innocent, your objective is to communicate with the other still-living innocent players and the cop (whose identity is unknown) to arrest all the killers. You may vote to kill one player every turn. <br>
	4. You can move 3000 meters each turn. Movement is based on the streets you walk to get to places. Cops can also choose to arrest a target player. <br>
	5. Hit end turn. This will refresh your movement and change the time from day to night or viceversa. (At night, your visibility is greatly reduced). <br>
	6. The game ends when either all killers are arrested or dead or all innocents and all cops are dead. <br>
